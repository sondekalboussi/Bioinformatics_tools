EvolView (http://www.evolgenius.info/evolview/#login) is an online tool for displaying, managing and customizing phylogenetic trees.
With EvolView, you can:
visualize phylogenetic trees of various formats,
add datasets and do customizations to phylogenetic trees,
export trees to various text (newick, nhx, phyloXML, etc) and graphic formats, and
organize trees, projects and datasets in an intuitive and efficient way.

The following folder contain different python scripts:

Phylogenies.py: generate evolview scripts to display a tree with different labels
