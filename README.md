EvolView (http://www.evolgenius.info/evolview/#login) and iTOL are online tools for displaying, managing and customizing phylogenetic trees.
With tese tools, you can:
visualize phylogenetic trees of various formats, add datasets and do customizations to phylogenetic trees, export trees to various text (newick, nhx, phyloXML, etc) and graphic formats, and organize trees, projects and datasets in an intuitive and efficient way.

The following folder contain different python scripts:

EVolview.py: generate evolview scripts to plot parameters from VCF file and metadata on the tree

add_lineage_to_Id.py: add lineage to sample-id in a tre or fasta file

raxml.py: create an alignment file from all the fastas and run raxml

iTOL.py: generate iTOL scripts to plot parameters from VCF file and metadata on the tree
